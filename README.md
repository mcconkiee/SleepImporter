This application is an example of how to import Suunto detailed sleep data into iOS usin Runalyze csv export as a proxy. 

## Why?
I use a Suunto watch (which i love) but the sleep data is only accessable in the Suunto app. After authenticating Runalyze to use this data, I realized it is accessable by the Suunto backend. I really would like this data in my Health app, and Suunto does not support Health. While I search for an easier way to make this importable to Health, for now i will use this work around

* Export sleep data from Runalyze, preferably onto your iOS device
* Open app, tap import
* navigate to the newly created CSV file from Runalyze
